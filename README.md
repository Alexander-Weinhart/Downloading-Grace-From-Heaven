----Email from John-----

Alex and Olivia,

It is an honor to know both of you and to have you working on this project!

Alex will do the coding, Olivia will do web design and copywriting. Emails are below.

The project is a complete redesign of https://downloadinggrace.com

It should become:

1. Responsive
2. Attractive
3. Fast-loading
4. Well written with a clear message. You can use either British spelling (**********) or USA spelling.
5. Images should be Creative Commons, please do not use any images that might be copyright protected.
6. Please do NOT use Wordpress, please code it in html, css, javascript etc. Use Dreamweaver or similar coding tools.
7. Try to SEO optimize head tags and the text on the web page with key-words such as grace, Christian, books, etc

I have invited you to a Github repository: https://github.com/johnedmiston/DGFH/

This is where you will store the code. If you need a test server we can arrange that as well, once you need it.

There is no rush. I understand life, exams etc. ****************************(censored)

Blessings,

John

----Alex's 2 cents----
Olivia will be doing the content, and because of Olivia's workload, I will be doing the design work and the coding. I have a project for school I have as well, 16-19 pages long.
